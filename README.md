# Solarized OSX

[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is by far my favorite color
scheme for anything terminal or text-editor, but sadly now seems to be
unmaintained. I've reimplemented Solarized for the most common OSX
applications, such as:

- iTerm2
- Terminal.app
- system color palette

If you've a favorite OSX application that is unlisted, I'm happy to add it to
the repo- just send me a pull request.
